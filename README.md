# Developer's and Quick Use Guide

* Meteor is required. You can download Meteor here: https://www.meteor.com/install

* Create a new directory.

* Use git clone to clone the repository into that directory:

  **git clone https://github.com/manoa-tckts/manoa-tckts.git**
  
* Go to the new directory that you created and navigate to the /app directory.

* Once in the /app directory, you will have to run:
    <br>**meteor npm install**
    
* To locally host the application, run this while you are still in the /app directory:
    <br>**meteor --settings ../config/settings.development.json**

* You can now open any browser and go to localhost:3000 to view the application.
